# Problem

A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return -1.

Example 
b = 60
keyboards = [40,40,60]
drives = [5,8,12]

The person can buy a 
40 keyboard + 12 USB drive = 52, or a 50 keyboard + 8USB drive = 58. Choose the latter as the more expensive option and return 58.

### Constraints 
1 <= n,m <= 1000
1 <= b <= 10^6
