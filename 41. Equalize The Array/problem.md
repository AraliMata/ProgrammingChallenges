# Problem:
Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements of equal value

Example:
arr = [1,2,2,3]

Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr = [2,2]. If both twos plus either the 1 or the 3 are deleted, it takes 3 deletions to leave either [3] or [1]. The minimum number of deletions is 2.

### Constraints
 1 <= n <= 100
 1 <= arr[i] <= 100
